###  What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment encompasses a range of behaviors that are unwelcome, inappropriate, and of a sexual nature. It is important to note that sexual harassment can occur in various contexts, such as the workplace, educational institutions, public spaces, and online platforms.

- **Cybersexual harassment:** Engaging in unwelcome online behavior, such as sending unsolicited explicit messages or images, cyberstalking, or spreading sexual rumors or content without consent.

- **Physical contact:** Unwanted touching, groping, or any other form of physical contact without consent, ranging from brushing against someone to more overtly sexual acts.

- **Sexual comments or jokes:** Making offensive or sexually explicit comments, jokes, or innuendos that create a hostile or uncomfortable environment.

- **Discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation:** Treating someone unfairly or making derogatory comments or actions based on their gender or sexual orientation, contributing to a hostile or discriminatory environment.

 ### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is important to take appropriate action. Here are some steps I can consider:

- **Assess the situation:** Determine if the behavior qualifies as sexual harassment and is not a misunderstanding or miscommunication.
- **Ensure your safety:** If you feel threatened or unsafe, remove yourself from the situation and seek immediate help if necessary.
- **Document the incidents:** Keep a record of dates, times, locations, descriptions of the incidents, and any other relevant details. This documentation can be valuable if you decide to report the harassment later.
- **Confront the harasser:** If you feel comfortable and safe doing so, consider directly addressing the individual involved, expressing your discomfort, and asking them to stop their behavior. However, it is essential to prioritize your safety and well-being.
- **Report the incidents:** Depending on the context, report the incidents to the appropriate authority or entity. Depending on the situation, this could be your employer, human resources department, educational institution, or law enforcement. Please provide them with your documentation and any other evidence available.
- **Seek support:** Reach out to trusted friends, family, or professionals who can provide emotional support and guidance throughout the process.
- **Know your rights:** Familiarize yourself with the relevant laws, policies, and procedures in your jurisdiction or organization regarding sexual harassment. This knowledge will help you understand your rights and the available avenues for resolution.

While these suggestions can be helpful, remember that each situation is unique, and it is essential to consider your personal safety, comfort level, and specific circumstances when deciding how to respond to incidents of sexual harassment.
